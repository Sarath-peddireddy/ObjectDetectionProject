# Object Detection Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Object Detection Project! This repository includes a model for detecting objects in images, videos, and real-time webcam feeds. The project demonstrates versatile object detection capabilities using various media formats.

## Features

- **Image Detection**: Analyze and detect objects in static images.
- **Video Detection**: Process video files and detect objects frame-by-frame.
- **Webcam Detection**: Perform real-time object detection using a webcam.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the object detection model:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sarath-peddireddy/ObjectDetectionProject.git
cd ObjectDetectionProject

### 2. Set Up the Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment:
conda create --name object-detection-env python=3.8
conda activate object-detection-env

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Image Detection
To detect objects in an image, run:
python detect_objects.py https://github.com/Sarath-peddireddy/ObjectDetectionProject/blob/main/boy.jpg

Video Detection
To detect objects in a video file, run:
python detect_objects.py https://github.com/Sarath-peddireddy/ObjectDetectionProject/blob/main/2954065-uhd_3840_2160_30fps.mp4

Webcam Detection
To start real-time object detection using your webcam, run:
python detect_objects.py --webcam
